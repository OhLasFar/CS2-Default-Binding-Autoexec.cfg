# Introduction

Welcome to this guide! It covers how to set up your new autoexec with ALL default bindings and even add secondary ones. Follow closely! A small mistake could mess things up. But don't worry; I've explained each step clearly. If you find this guide helpful, please give it a star. And hey, a follow on Twitter [@OhLasFar](https://twitter.com/OhLasFar) would make my day!

The guide is divided into 5 easy-to-follow steps. You can find these steps labeled in the `autoexec.cfg` file too.

Additionally, it's crucial to integrate or merge your `autoexec.cfg` into the specified path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`.

# Step 1: Setting Default Key Bindings

Set up your primary key bindings using the following alias commands. These commands ensure you can quickly revert to your original bindings after using the secondary keybinds and are crucial for the secondary bindings to function as expected.
```
alias PrimaryWeapon "bind 2 slot1"       // Primary Weapon 
alias SecondaryWeapon "bind 3 slot2"     // Secondary Weapon 
alias MeleeWeapon "bind 1 slot3"         // Melee Weapon 
alias CycleGrenades "bind 4 slot4"       // Cycle Grenades 
```

If you decide to change or remove an alias, like `PrimaryWeapon`, you can directly use `bind 2 slot1` instead of `alias PrimaryWeapon "bind 2 slot1"`. It'll function normally. However, if you adjust or remove the alias here, ensure to also modify it in Step 4.

After setting these aliases, bind the keys you use regularly. Ensure each key is matched to its intended action.

For example:
| Command       | Key           | Action        | Comment (Not necessary) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| bind          | g             | drop          | // Drop Weapon          |
| bind          | f             | +lookatweapon | // Inspect Weapon       |


In `autoexec.cfg`, it should look like:
```
...
alias PrimaryWeapon "bind 2 slot1"      // Primary Weapon 
alias SecondaryWeapon "bind 3 slot2"    // Secondary Weapon 
...
bind g drop				// Drop Weapon
bind f +lookatweapon			// Inspect Weapon
...
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: always use lowercase for keybinding letters.

# Step 2: Creating Aliases for Secondary Keybinds

Create aliases for your secondary keybind actions. __Make sure each alias name is unique!__

For instance:
| Macro   | Alias Name       | Action       |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| alias   | MolotovSlot      | slot10       |
| alias   | FlashbangSlot    | slot7        |
| alias   | HEGrenadeSlot    | slot4        |
| alias   | SmokeGrenadeSlot | slot8        |

Not sure about available actions? Check out the file at:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\user_keys_default.vcfg`

üí° Actions can be found to the right in this file and be careful the action will always equal to the binding next to it even if you do the command `unbindall`. 


# Step 3: Setting Up Secondary Key Bindings

Assign actions to your aliases. For instance, the alias "`MolotovSecond`" links to the command "`bind 1 MolotovSlot`".

Note: Always use quotation marks (" ") for full console commands.
| Macro   | Alias Name          | Full Console Command      |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| alias   | MolotovSecond       | "bind 1 MolotovSlot"      |
| alias   | FlashbangSecond     | "bind 4 FlashbangSlot"    |
| alias   | HEGrenadeSecond     | "bind 3 HEGrenadeSlot"    |
| alias   | SmokeGrenadeSecond  | "bind 2 SmokeGrenadeSlot" |

This step ensures that when you press your binded key (defined in Step 5), it will reassign new functions to your keys.

# Step 4: Toggle Logic

This step covers the logic to switch between primary and secondary keybinds.

For activation:
| Macro   | Alias Name          | Full Console Command                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alias   | +secondarycommand   | "MolotovSecond; FlashbangSecond; HEGrenadeSecond; SmokeGrenadeSecond"  |

For deactivation:
| Macro   | Alias Name          | Full Console Command                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alias   | -secondarycommand   | "PrimaryWeapon; SecondaryWeapon; MeleeWeapon; CycleGrenades"           |

üí° Always separate commands with a semicolon (;) but skip it for the last command.
Note: When using the PrimaryWeapon alias (or any other alias), it's equivalent to manually entering the command "bind 2 slot1" in the game console.

# Step 5: Toggle Secondary Keybinds

Lastly, bind a key to toggle between the primary and secondary commands.

| Command       | Key           | Action            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| bind          | mouse5        | +secondarycommand |

Pressing this key activates your secondary keybinds, and releasing it goes back to primary ones.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Q: I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this. You want to be able to pull your knife with 1, but also pull a molotov if you hold some key and then press 1?

### A:
That's correct! It's for better and easy access to your utilities or any other actions and/or custom bindings so you can access them more efficiently. While the default is set to 1,2,3, or 4, you're free to bind them to any other key like "g" or another letter.

## Q: Why not just bind utilities to different keys?

### A:
This really boils down to personal preference. For some, including me, accidentally pressing utilities bound to adjacent keys can be frustrating. The primary goal is to avoid cycling through an entire stack of grenades to get to the one you need. With this setup, you can use the 1,2,3, & 4 keys or any key of your preference. Plus, while the setup comes with only four secondary keybinds by default, you can add as many as you want. This is also beneficial for players using one-handed keyboards.

## Q: Can I use custom bindings with this configuration? For example, can I bind a custom jumpthrow to the secondary bindings?

### A:
Absolutely! The setup is designed to be versatile. Besides the preset functions, you can incorporate custom bindings, such as a specific jumpthrow or any other custom command, to the secondary bindings. This offers flexibility for unique gameplay styles and preferences.
