*Not final guide*

> This guide is for enhancing your Counter-Strike 2 gameplay with better secondary commands made by **OhLasFar on Twitter**.

# Step 1: DEFINE YOUR DEFAULT COMMANDS

1. Navigate to the **'Part 1'** section of the autoexec.cfg.
2. Bind all the keybinds you typically use.

While most lines don't start with the word `alias`, it's possible to delete them, but not recommended.
Lines in 'Part 1' starting with `alias` are essential for secondary commands. It's recommended to name them for easy identification. 
Example: ```alias MeleeWeapon "bind 1 slot3"```
- "MeleeWeapon" is the name of the alias
- "bind 1 slot3" is the full command of the binding

> If you are unsure about available commands, refer to: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\user_keys_default.vcfg``` In the file you will find the number or the letter to the left then the action command to the right. 


# Step 2: SET ALIAS COMMANDS

1. Name all aliases meaningfully and assign a specific command to each.

2. There's a limit on the number of default commands, find them at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\user_keys_default.vcfg


# Step 3: NAME YOUR ALIASES & SET CORRESPONDING KEYBINDS

1. Give unique names to your aliases. Avoid duplicate names to prevent issues.

 > ⚠️ **Attention**: NEVER use identical alias names.

2. There are default keybinds like 1, 2, 3, and 4. Modify them as per your preferences, ensuring they match with the `alias` lines in 'Part 1'.

# Step 4: MODIFY ALIASES FOR SECONDARY COMMANDS

1. Start with **'Part 1'**:
- Add new aliases with `-secondarycommand`.
- Remove unnecessary ones.
- Modify existing aliases if needed.

2. Proceed to **'Part 3'** and:
- Add new aliases with `+secondarycommand`.
- Remove or adjust any that don't fit your setup.

# Step 5: SETTING THE TOGGLE KEYBIND FOR SECONDARY COMMANDS

1. Decide on a key to toggle your secondary keybinds.
2. Bind this key to switch between primary and secondary commands. This key helps to seamlessly shift between command sets.
